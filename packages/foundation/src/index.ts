/**
 * Platform Resource Identifier (PRI)
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Almost anything in the Anticrm Platform is a `Resource`. Resources referenced by Platform Resource Identifier (PRI).
 *
 * TODO: understand Resource better. Is this just a `platform` thing or should be in `core` as well
 *
 * 'Resource' is simply any JavaScript object. There is a plugin exists, which 'resolve' PRI into actual object.
 * This is a difference from Metadata. Metadata object 'resolved' by Platform instance, so we may consider Metadata as
 * a Resource, provided by Platform itself. Because there is always a plugin, which resolve `Resource` resolution is
 * asynchronous process.
 *
 * `Resource` is a string of `kind:plugin.id` format. Since Metadata is a kind of Resource.
 * Metadata also can be resolved using resource API.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 *   `class:contact.Person` as Resource<Class<Person>> // database object with id === `class:contact.Person`
 *   `string:class.ClassLabel` as Resource<string> // translated string according to current language and i18n settings
 *   `asset:ui.Icons` as Resource<URL> // URL to SVG sprites
 *   `easyscript:2+2` as Resource<() => number> // function
 * ```
 *
 * @public
